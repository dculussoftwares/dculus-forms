  - Case-insensitive search
  - Includes organization memberships with roles

#### `adminUserById` Query
- **Purpose**: Fetch detailed information for a single user
- **Parameters**: `id` (String): User ID

### 5. Routing & Navigation

**File**: `apps/admin-app/src/App.tsx`

**New Routes Added**:

- Both card view and table view navigate to organization detail page

**Sidebar**: Already included "Users" link in navigation

---

## Navigation Flow

```
Admin Dashboard
    │
    ├─→ Users (/users)
    │     │
    │     ├─→ User Detail (/users/:userId)
    │     │     └─→ Organization Detail (/organizations/:orgId)
    │     │
    │     └─→ Organization Detail (from user card)
    │
    └─→ Organizations (/organizations)
          └─→ Organization Detail (/organizations/:orgId)
                └─→ User Detail (/users/:userId)
```

**Bidirectional Navigation**:
- Users → Organizations (via "View Org" links)
- Organizations → Users (via "View User" links)
- All pages have "Back" buttons

---

## Key Features

### 1. Search & Filtering
- Debounced search (300ms)
- Case-insensitive search by name or email
- Resets to page 1 on new search

### 2. Pagination
- Server-side pagination (20 items per page)
- Previous/Next navigation
- Page number display
- Disabled buttons at boundaries

### 3. Loading & Error States
- Spinner with message during loading
- Error display with retry button
- Empty states with icons and messages

### 4. Responsive Design
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Mobile-friendly cards
- Touch-friendly buttons

### 5. Visual Design
- Gradient avatars for users without images
- Color-coded role badges (Owner/Admin/User)
- Icons from Lucide React
- Consistent card styling
- Dark mode support

### 6. Type Safety
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Typed GraphQL queries
- Interface definitions for all components

---

## Authorization

All admin queries require:
- User must be authenticated
- User role must be `admin` or `superAdmin`
- Implemented via `requireAdminRole()` helper function

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Backend Tests**:
   - Test `adminUsers` with pagination
   - Test search functionality
   - Test authorization (non-admin access)
   - Test error handling (invalid user/org IDs)

2. **Frontend Tests**:
   - Test user card rendering
   - Test search debouncing
   - Test pagination navigation
   - Test loading/error states
   - Test bidirectional navigation

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full user detail → org detail → user detail cycle
   - Test search → view details flow
   - Test pagination across multiple pages

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Phase 2: Filtering & Sorting**
   - Filter by role (user/owner/admin)
   - Filter by organization
   - Sort by name, email, created date
   - Filter by email verification status

2. **Phase 3: User Management Actions**
   - Suspend/unsuspend user accounts
   - Remove user from organization
   - Change user role in organization
   - Delete user account (with confirmation)

3. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Bulk actions (select multiple users)
   - Export user list to CSV
   - Send email to user
   - View user activity logs
   - View user's forms and responses

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Add tooltips
   - Add breadcrumbs navigation
   - Add activity timeline
   - Add last active timestamp
   - Add session information

---

## Database Performance Notes

- All queries include proper indexes on `User` and `Member` collections
- Pagination prevents loading all users at once
- Organization member queries are optimized with selective field inclusion
- Consider adding database indexes on frequently searched fields (name, email)

---

## Security Considerations

- All admin queries check for admin/superAdmin role
- User IDs and organization IDs are validated
- No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) exposed in queries
- GraphQL errors sanitized for client display

---

**Implementation Complete** ✅

All planned features for Phase 1 (Basic List & Details) have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.
