  } 
/>
```

### 9. Environment Variables Set

VITE_FORM_VIEWER_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## 🚀 Development Server Status

**Status:** ✅ Running successfully on `http://localhost:3001`

```bash
# Start the server
pnpm --filter form-app-v2 dev

# Or from form-app-v2 directory
pnpm dev
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Phase 1

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   pnpm backend:dev
   ```

2. **Start Form App V2:**
   ```bash
   pnpm form-app-v2:dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to Builder:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
   - Sign in with credentials
   - Create or select a form
   - Click "Edit" or manually navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:3001/dashboard/form/{formId}/collaborate/page-builder
     ```

4. **Verify Functionality:**
   - ✅ Page loads without errors
   - ✅ Shows "Connected" badge (green)
   - ✅ Displays form title
   - ✅ Shows page count
   - ✅ Shows permission level
   - ✅ Tab navigation works (layout, page-builder, preview, settings)
   - ✅ YJS connection established (check console)

5. **Test Multi-User Collaboration:**
   - Open form in two browser tabs/windows
   - Both should show "Connected"
   - Watch for real-time sync messages in console

## 🔜 Next Steps (Phase 2: Layout Tab)

Now that the foundation is complete, we can proceed to Phase 2:

### Phase 2 Tasks:
1. Create `apps/form-app-v2/src/components/collaborative-builder/layout/` directory
2. Implement `LayoutTab.tsx` - Main layout tab component
3. Implement `LayoutSidebar.tsx` - Sidebar with Shadcn Sheet
4. Implement `LayoutThumbnails.tsx` - Layout picker (L1-L9)
5. Implement `LayoutOptions.tsx` - Theme/color/spacing controls
6. Implement `BackgroundControls.tsx` - Image upload/Pixabay browser
7. Integrate `FormRenderer` from `@dculus/ui` with BUILDER mode
8. Test real-time layout updates across multiple users

### Estimated Timeline:
- **Phase 2:** 1 week (5-7 days)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### ✅ RESOLVED: Module Export Errors

**Issue:** `The requested module does not provide an export named 'FormLayout'`

**Solution:** Build all shared packages before starting dev server:
```bash
pnpm --filter "@dculus/*" build
pnpm --filter form-app-v2 dev
```

### Other Issues:

1. **Node.js Version Warning:**
   - Warning: "You are using Node.js 22.11.0. Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+."
   - Status: ⚠️ Warning only - server works correctly
   - Fix: Optional upgrade to Node.js 22.12+ or 20.19+

2. **TypeScript Warnings:**
   - Some `any` types in store (inherited from V1)
   - Status: Non-blocking, works as expected
   - Fix: Phase 7 (Testing & Polish) will address type safety

3. **Lint Warnings:**
   - Unused variables in hooks (intentional placeholders)
   - Status: Will be used in Phase 3 (Page Builder)
   - Fix: No action needed now

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **YJS Integration is Preserved:**
   - Same logic as V1, no breaking changes
   - Real-time collaboration works out of the box

2. **Shared Packages Work Seamlessly:**
   - `@dculus/types`, `@dculus/ui`, `@dculus/utils` integrated smoothly
   - Workspace protocol (`workspace:*`) handled correctly by pnpm

3. **Vite Configuration:**
   - Path aliases (`@/`) working correctly
   - Environment variables using `import.meta.env`
   - Fast HMR for development

4. **Component Architecture:**
   - Clean separation: store → contexts → hooks → components
   - Easy to test and maintain
   - Follows V2 design principles
